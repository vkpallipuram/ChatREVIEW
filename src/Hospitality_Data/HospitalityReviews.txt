I like this hotel. I
stayed here for
business. The
room was
spacious and
clean. Service is
overall OK.
Housekeeping did
a great job turning
the room into a
brand-new one.
The bathroom is
clean. The bar
has decent food
and drinks. It is
super close to the
airport, which is a
huge plus. The
only downside is it
can be a bit
expensive to stay.
Nonetheless, I will
come back for
business or
leisure.                   5
Wifi is $15 a day
unless you sign
up for an account.
The sign up
process is filled
with errors and
problems. My
ground floor room
had a large
window that
looked directly at
a beige wall.
Occasionally
dumpsters would
roll past. The
room is modern
but poorly put
together. For
example, loose
screws are visible
in a number of
places. The walls
are very thin and
you can hear quite
a bit of noise from
your neighbors.
You can hear all
of the sounds from
the hallway
perfectly,
including word for
word
conversations.
The hotel is
located in a sea of
highways and
parking lots.
There is nothing
close by to walk
to. If you are
staying here, it is
almost certainly
for work.                  1
Newly updated.
Lobby bar has
decent food.
Room air
conditioners
though are old
and super loud.
Staff is great as
well                  4

Beautiful place.
Confusing to
navigate. The
bar/restaurant
was full of bros
from conventions,
which was a
bummer. Front
desk service was
great. I love the
order from room
and pick up
service for food.     4
Very good
location but a bit
old and needs a
proper renovation!
The breakfast was
ok as part of
lounge access as
a member. I had
two major
incidents there but
they were both
resolved later and
I was offered
points.               3
Went for a game
convention. There
was plenty of
room for all the
activities. The
restaurants on site
, including grab
and go options,
seemed a bit over
priced for what
you get . The few
issues we had
were quickly and
easily resolved.
The staff is
friendly,
courteous, and
helpful.              4
This hotel offers
some great
amenities and has
been nicely
remodeled , but
DO NOT book a
room if you would
like to get a good
night’s sleep.
They allow
extremely loud
events with
pounding, base-
heavy music until
midnight (with the
noise of party
attendees on top).
If you happen to
be in a room that
is close to one of
the event spaces,
your windows will
rattle                1
A dated property
but kept up well
enough. Of the
places to stay in
the area it is one
of the better
choices, but the
bar in this area is
low. Speaking of
bars, the one at
the hotel is fine
but the prices are
a bit too high for
what they deliver
in food and drink.
                      3
We came there for
work. We spent
there five days
and there was no
hot water in the
shower for the
entire 5 days. The
water weren't cold
but it wasn't hot
and on December
when it is cold
outside, you
expect the water
to be boiled. It
doesn't seem only
in my room.           1
The hotel is
located at a great
place. The room
was cleaned and
nicely appointed.
The Elite line
could be
managed better
and an all-day
coffee option is
needed.               4
We are here for
business trip.
Comfortable stay
overall, but not
good sound
insulation            4
Traveled here for
work purposes,
had a great time
and especially
great service from
the hotel workers.
Helped me switch
a more suitable
room for my
needs . Thank
you,
recommended to
others.               4
Two star for a nice
room and location!
Customer service
is poor. 0 star! I
stayed over the
weekend and
checked early
using mobile key.
The mobile key
worked for the
garage but did not
work for my room.
Called in to the
front desk and no
one answers the
call. I decided to
walk down to the
front desk and told
them about the
issue. They just
look at me like I'm
crazy and did not
even smile or say
hello. Did not
even say sorry. It
seems that they
don't want to be
there. Marriott
should hire better
front desk support
as they are the
face of customer.
Another issue that
seems to be
recruisance is the
showtime. Please
do not offer if you
can't get it to
work.
                       1
Check in was the
worst experience I
have ever had.
The line for check
in was incredibly
long. There were
at least 150
people in line and
took forever. If you
have a large
capacity hotel with
a large event
happening, you
should be staffed
to handle same.        1
The staff at this
hotel is what
makes it great.
They are all super
helpful and
friendly. They
really make it an
inviting place to
be. It was
incredibly
crowded and
busy, but still,
every single staff
member I
interacted with
was kind and
warm. Wonderful
experience.            4
Very loud hotel.
3:30-4 am party in
the hallways. The
walls are so thin
you can hear your
neighbors using
the restroom.
Would not return
to this hotel for
anything. Also
they never
emailed me the
receipt as they
said they would.      1
Great hotel -
clean, equipped
gym, and friendly
staff. The
bartender is one
of the sweetest
human beings and
would go back just
so I can see him!
Let me try a few
wines before
buying a bottle
and had a genuine
conversation.         5
Spent 6 days
there. Good thing
was they have
kitchen. Free
Breakfast was
good. Room was
clean. Most
Parking spots are
super narrow, not
safe for your car
paint. And they
charge $10 a day
for parking. Room
window only
opens a tiny crack
so you cannot get
good air
circulation. They
do not clean room
until I checked out
after 6 days. I
would have
chosen 2nd floor
but I didn't think
about upstair
noise issue when I
checked in. I
wouldn't go back
unless I need a
kitchen during my
stay.
                      3
The room is nice
and clean but you
can still hear
noise outside from
the theme park
and traffic nearby.
I went out to local
nearby
restaurants and
the food is really
good. The
employees are
very nice and
courteous.            4
Horrible noise
from AC and toilet
when flush.
Shower water too
small. extra
charge for wifi.       1
Fire alarm went
off a couple of
times late at night.
Everyone
evacuated for a
false alarm.
Otherwise. Meh.        3
There was blood
all over the ceiling
and wall and
lampshade in my
room, but they
didn’t change our
room because
they were
understaffed and
overwhelmed.
There was only
one towel in the
room and
housekeeping
was unable to
bring another one,
even after two
hours of waiting.
Management
ignored both of
these requests.        1
Well, this hotel is
way below my
expectations. It
looks great from
the outside but
living in it does
not feel that great.
First, the check-in
was quick but the
front desk did not
provide any
information about
Wi-Fi access or
coffee. When we
get into the room
we realize that we
need to pay for
the Wi-Fi, or need
to register a
membership
account to access
the Wi-Fi
                       2
Very comfortable,
i loved that they
had spray for me
to use on my
bedding. Very
cozy Restaurant
in the lobby was
delicious              5
Very good
location close to
some tech
companies. Can
walk to a few
lunch places.
Hotel is a bit
dated from
outside, rooms
are well kept.         4
Very nice and well
maintained
property. Rooms
are fantastic,
spacious, with
nice bathrooms
and very
comfortable beds.
Excellent food on
premises. I'd give
it 5 stars, if not for
the M-Lounge -
we were offered
an upgrade, which
we took, but were
not explained that
the bar portion of
the lounge (beer
on tap) is closed
Fridays and
Saturdays -
exactly when we
stayed there!
Basically, it turned
out to be
breakfast only
(which was good,
in fairness), which
made it a bit
pricey. Otherwise,
we had a great
experience, and
we'll gladly stay
here again on our
next visit.              4
Very nice, clean.
One heck of an
operation. Large
an I mean jumbo
sized. Get your
track shoes on
you well need
then.
                         4
Disappointing
stay. Loud
neighbors, room
near conference
rooms, digital key
didn’t work,
checking in online
didn’t work, TV
reception was
terrible, requested
room
characteristics
(high floor, quiet
sector) ignored,
no direction as to
how to use in-
room safe.               2
A great hotel that
houses two
gaming
conventions that I
attend. The staff is
friendly and its a
nice place to stay.
They have a large
pool with a large
part that is super
kid friendly as it is
only 3 1/2 feet for
half of the pool.
This was really
neat when my son
was very young
and learning to
swim. They
recently
remodeled the
hotel and it looks
very modern.            4
They are in the
middle of
renovation so that,
and the standard
knock on hotel
food pricing are
the only
downside. The
staff is excellent.
The rooms nice.
Don't get a room
near the pool if
you enjoy peace
and quiet. Lots of
excellent food
options within
walking distance.       4
Every single staff
member that I
came across in
this hotel were
exceptional.
Nothing was too
much trouble from
the cleaning staff
to security and
reception. My bed
was super
comfortable and
the power-shower
was great. My
reason for only a
4 star rating is
because of all the
construction work
going on, and
because finding
my room on the
first day was very
confusing. The
staff were
definitely 5 star
though.
                        4
This is one of the
most, if not the
most expensive
hotels in this area.
It's nothing
special, and you
get charged for all
kinds of extras.
Parking, coffee,
etc, and no daily
room service. I
only chose it
because it's close
to where I was
working.               2
We stayed here
for two nights and
it was close to
many things.
Parking is great
for $17 and in and
out service. I
would recommend
this hotel to
others. The rooms
cleanliness is a
4/5                    4
Staff is always
very nice and
accommodating
for our family.
Even in COVID
times they do a
good job. For
platinum
members they
always have a
great breakfast.
We always get
connecting rooms
and the hotel
accommodates.          5
While the
aesthetics &
cleanliness of this
hotel is 4-5 stars,
the service and
food ranked 1-2
stars. It doesn't
matter how nice it
is to look at when
your experiences
are continuously
tarnished with
rudeness and
poor quality           2
Thank you to the
staff who went
above and beyond
to make guests
feel welcome and
safe. It is clear
that they are
understaffed, but
you wouldn't know
that by the
kindness and joy
the front of house
team bring to work
every day.             5
Went to
Character's Sports
Bar and Grill. It
has plenty of TVs
all around the
room and very
comfortable.
Definitely a more
upscale
experience than
your typical sports
bar. Food is also
surprisingly good.
I was expecting
your usual bar
fare but my meal
was actually very
gourmet and the
portion size is
generous. Of
course the price
point is higher but
we enjoyed the
classy
atmosphere. Also
very clean.           5
Excellent
customer service
from the front
desk. Additionally
when ordering
food from the in-
room menu app
for pickup you will
be very pleasantly
surprised by the
quality and
quantity of the
food ordered.
Very positive
experience. I will
continue returning
to this property.     5
Rooms was tidy
however it was a
smaller less
appointed
bathroom than
expected and it
would have been
nice to have a
fridge. The
restaurant staff
was great but the
concierge staff
seem to be more
concerned with
gossip about other
staff than helping
guests. I would
definitely stay
there again
though.               5
I’m a fan of this
hotel. For
members gold
stars and above,
the concierge
lounge is pretty
nice and spacious.
The staff is great.
The work out
facility is above
average
especially for
cardio equipment.
The pool is above
average as well.
Location is
convenient to the
hwy 101. For my
visit, parking was
free since I used
mobile checkin.
Nice perk to ask
for. The room I
stayed in had a
balcony which is
also a nice feature     5
The room itself
was OK, though it
had no refrigerator
to keep stuff cold
nor no microwave
in which to warm
stuff. Bathroom
was pretty small
and had no
ventilation fan, just
a small vent
opening on the
wall above the
shower head.
Beds were plenty
comfy. Plenty of
places to charge
electronics. In the
lobby, there isn't a
pitcher of cold
water for guests
like many hotels
provide, but there
is an area in
which you can buy
Starbucks drinks
(just double check
that there is
flavoring in the
drink if you
ordered it).            3
The location was
convenient for us
and close to the
freeway. The
hotel and rooms
are a bit older but
still clean and look
nice. The pool is
huge and so are
the two gym
rooms. The staff
were amazing and
went above and
beyond to make
us feel welcome
and comfortable.
It was my one
year olds birthday
and they all
signed a card and
sent up cookies,
milk and a couple
little toys to the
room.                   5
No space to park
while checking in
to the hotel,
ludicrous
overnight parking
charge, and
charging for tiered
wifi in 2019. After
reserving a king
room, I was given
a dual queen that
was "newly
renovated." It was
simultaneously
brand new and
filthy, clearly not
cleaned
thoroughly, zero
water pressure in
the admittedly
impressive-
looking shower,
and to top it all off
the heat didn't
work. At least I
was able to check
out direction the
TV so I could get
out of there
quickly.                2
Received poor
communication at
check-in regarding
incidental
charges. Despite
requesting the bill
be emailed at
check-out I had to
follow up a few
days later in order
to receive one and
clarify charges.
The room was
clean but had to
request plastic
cups because
they didn't restock
them between
guests. I've had
better stays and
customer service
here in the past,
but this recent
stay left me a bit
frustrated. Overall
it felt safe
regarding COVID-
19 practices which
was about the
only upside.          2
Renovated rooms
have srrange
lighting. Spacious
bathroom with tiny
sink and walk in
shower.
Thermostat
installed but not
working. Older
noisy unit in
corner. Rooms on
first floor have no
privacy without
blackout curtains
drawn.
Restaurants and
bar are pleasant.
Good wine list.
Limited food
selections for
vegetarians. Food
and drink
expensive.            3
They charged
$315 for a room
that hasn't been
updated in... Hell
knows how long,
and there was a
lot of pipe noise
from when hotel
guests would turn
on hot water in
shower. Honestly,
motel 6 looks
nicer than this
"upscale hotel".
The smell is
musty and the a/c
is old and loud. I
would give one
star (price/quality
ratio is really bad)
but the hotel staff
was really
pleasant and
upgraded us to a
nicer room. It is
still hard to
understand why
they would charge
so much for the
room that's in the
picture.               2
 There was some
street noise. The
heater/ac system
is also noisy. The
carpet had stains
between the beds.
The shower didn’t
have hot water.        3
The bed was hard
as a rock, had to
take showers in
the morning just to
get stretched out
and not ache. The
pillows were so
soft I needed to
make a ball out of
it, to get any
support.               3
Small rooms with
a tiny, very old
fashioned
bathroom. You will
have to wrestle
with the cloth
curtains in the
shower as they try
to wrap all over
you. The hotel
facilities are fine
and the service is
kind and friendly,
but the rooms are
in need of a
renovation.            3
The staff is
wonderful. Kids
love it here and so
do I. Nice size
pool. We always
get the pool side
view.                  5
Everything has
been fine about
this hotel. The
location is great.
The service is
great. Parking
was smooth and
easy. Everything
has been fine here
except the price,
which is
stunningly
overpriced. This is
the only reason I
am giving 3 stars.
There is no
earthly legitimate
reason to charge
this amount for a
hotel room, even
factoring in
jacking up the
price for a posh
conference that
most people are
putting on their
expense account.
While every level
of service has
been great, I
would not stay
here again at this
price.                3
The hotel is clean,
well appointed
and maintained.
All of the staff
were genuinely
friendly and
helpful - I would
be proud if they
were my
employees.
Excellent wired
and wireless
connectivity. This
has become my
go to hotel for the
area. It was better
than my
expectations.         5
Decent fitness
center and pool.
Hallways to rooms
look like a college
dorm. Rooms
have window ac
units, ceilings are
low and showers
are old school
tubs not designed
for taller people.
Bathrooms are
tiny and so is the
entry door to get
into them. Rooms
are overdue for an
upgrade in both
decor and
furniture. Beds are
comfortable. Still
no real eggs for
breakfast             3
Hot tub out of
order with no
urgency to fix it --
very
disappointing.
Very dirty under
the beds - lots of
bottles and other
garbage.
Advertised as
being fancy but
rooms were very
plain. Weight
room was tiny with
surprisingly very
little equipment -- I
mean really small,
could fit more than
3 of us. Very small
for such a huge
hotel. No weight
machines.               2
Although the
check-in line was
long, the staffs
were pleasant and
helpful. Room is
big but a bit dark.
Decor has been
updated with USB
charging plugs at
the desk and near
the bed. It's an
expensive hotel.        4
Nice quiet hotel
with extremely
courteous staff.
We were there for
a developer
conference and a
group of us stayed
up very late in the
lobby of the hotel.
We were having a
lot of fun and we
were a very noisy
group. Security
staff didn't try to
shut us down but
helped us get
water for the
guests. They put
up with us when
they didn't have to
and they helped
us out.                 5
Mediocre rooms.
Water does not
flow in the taps.
This hotel has
taken water
conservation to a
level where the
ROI is not there
anymore.                3
Such an odd
hotel. Its huge. A
bit of a maze and
the elevators
rarely worked
during a 4 day
stay. The gym is
large but the staff
didn't keep up well
with the water and
towels. Overall
nice but some odd
things here and
there.                 3
I've stayed st this
hotel 10+ times
for business. It
has been nicely
remodeled but the
staff has allowed it
to devolve into a
weekend free for
all where locals
wheel in with their
kids and coolers
to lounge at the
pool or in the
spacious lobby
area at guests'
expense. Very
unimpressive.          2
The hotel looks
more dated than
photos online
showed (property
seemed run down
— rooms were a
little better) and
this is completely
my fault for not
looking into it
more when
booking, but it
was a little
sketchy. Stayed
here for a concert
and when we got
back there were
police cars on the
property and
walking one of the
corridors.             3
It’s basically a
Days in without
the mold. There
seems to only be
one person
working the desk.
Feel bad for them
since they have to
work a hotel next
to an airport and
Wyndham can’t
be bothered to
have 2 people
there so at least
they can have a
chance to answer
some of the
phone calls. It’s a
very dark motel.
They definitely did
renovations, but
must have hired
the cheapest
person they could
find and it really
shows.                1
This hotel was
very sketchy and
unsafe. The
property itself is
filthy. The rooms
are clean but very
small. The front
desk is not
friendly and
doesn’t smile or
greet. My kids and
I were very afraid
by the pool at
night. There were
3 men down there
up to no good.
They were
recording my girls
in the pool. We
got the yell out if
they’re as fast as
we could. Front
desk did nothing
about it.             2
Extremely
disappointed and
disgusted. We
stayed here for a
night before my
brother moved in
to college for the
first time, and
what was meant
to be a
memorable day
just became
stressful. Firstly,
the room did not
feel thoroughly
cleaned due to an
odd smell, tissues
looking used, and
half used roll of
toilet paper. While
we were checking
out and about to
leave for his
orientation, we
noticed that there
were a whole
bunch of ants by
the AC unit and
they had gotten
into all of our stuff.   1
This hotel is a
motel like, we only
went to ck in and
sleep so we didn't
explore the hotel.
Is close to the
airport and 15 min
to the Winchester
House and their
new downtown
area around
Winchester
House, it has a
swimming pool.
My only bad
experience at this
hotel was my
expectations
about this hotel, it
was not what I
Imaging given the
name.                    3
Listen, for 81$
during the week,
you get what the
price commands.
If you are staying
during a weekend,
stay in Cupertino
where Hotels like
Aloft and the
Cupertino Hotel
are with deep
discounts. During
the week this is
one of the
cheapest places
to stay in the city.
Definitely in a
rough
neighborhood, but
overall felt safe
once I was inside
the room. Request
a room on the
inside instead of
outside, felt much
safer. Overall
everything
worked, the rooms
were clean and
smelled like
cleaner (which id
rather they smell
like instead of
smelling unclean).     3
So disgusting.
Mold smell, sound
of cars doing
donuts, walls
paper thin, killed a
spider, checked
out within and
hour of checking
in. Of course
Priscilla refused a
refund. Went over
to the Hilton and
me and my family
had a good night
rest.                  1
Place is a dump.
Nohing really local
to eat or dine.
Service was
terrible. Booked
two rooms and
was only able to
get one room.
Had to wait in ny
car til the one
room was
available. Rooms
aren’t the
cleanest. And
there’s a great
chance you won’t
get your deposit
back after you
check out.             1
My room had
flying bugs in it
but I was only
staying one night
so I didn't make a
big deal out of it.
Woke up in the
morning to find
out my van had
been broken into
and all my tools
stolen. I asked if
they had cameras
and they said their
replacing them.         1
Their website
says that it had
hot breakfast and
pool/jacuzzi for
some of its
amenities.
Because of this
and its lowest
price of the area,
we decided to
book this place.
Unfortunately
when we got
there, they said
that they do not
serve breakfast,
and the pool area
was closed. It was
a huge
disappointment.
There are no
breakfast
restaurants or
stores (except for
a 7-11) nearby, so
it was a challenge
to have a decent
breakfast during
our stay. Service
was okay. Room
was clean. But I
don't think we'll
stay here ever
again, though.          3
The hotel smelled
funny. It was dirty.
The service was
bad. The music
was bad. The
furniture felt out of
place. Their "free"
shuttle service
barely runs if at
all. Desk
attendant was
rude. The carpets
in the hallways
were torn, some
lights were out.
Bad                     1
Denied access to
public bathrooms
on site shortly
after checkout.
Staff told us that
they had lost the
keys to both the
men's and
women's
restrooms, but
that was untrue.
Very unfriendly
and
accommodating
and we will not be
staying here
again.                  1
ou could tell the
facility was built in
the 70s with
interior
renovations, but
some things -
doors and closets,
still looked like
they were from
the 70s. But
everything else
was nicely
updated.                4
Hotel rooms are
nice although they
don't have a mini
fridge which is odd
in 2018. The hotel
itself is a maze
and you need a
map, a tour guide,
and a compass to
find your room.
The price of
parking is
outrageous.
Wouldn't stay
here again unless
I have no choice.       3
Renovations
going on and it is
total mess. Total
maze to get to the
room. No easy
parking (25 for
valet and 15 for
self parking). No
free breakfast.
Room cost is so
high ($319 + per
day) but no
comforts. On top
of it the curtains
were torn (have
pictures of it).
Only good point is
it is close to my
office.
                        1
The reception
area is good
smelling and very
nice but the rooms
are foul smelling.
Not dirty, just a
foul smell. Some
rooms smell like
Marijuana some
smell like standing
water.                  3
The curtain in the
two rooms I
stayed in were
smelly and very
dirty which made
the rooms smell
terrible.                3
The room was
nice. The front
desk was great
service. The area
was slightly
sketchy. There
was a woman at
3am yelling for
someone to open
the door. Not sure
what happened
but luckily I ended
up falling back
asleep. We got a
great price which
is why we booked
it. Not sure if I
would stay again.        4
Room was filthy.
Hairs in bath tub
and huge gap
underneath door
letting bugs in. I
left after 20
minutes and am
waiting for a
refund, didn’t
bother with front
desk. Not a good
area either.             1
Ok the glamour
resort photos on
Priceline do not
match, this place
was really seedy
and I felt very
unsafe here
mainly. Staff was
very nice friendly
and help full.
Room was ok but
very darkly lit. It is
a motel, I thought
from the photos
that it was a hotel
but you go around
back to enter, I
was in San Jose
for a Job an I felt
very
uncomfortable
walking through
the parking lot
because men in
just sitting cars
kept hitting on me
and acting sketch.
At night people
were car racing in
the parking lot and
homeless wonder
the halls... Was a
scary place
honestly.
                         2
PG&E on 4th day
of no power at
home, so escaped
into this hotel.
What a MISTAKE!
I would have been
better off in the
dark with no heat
than in the dirty
carpets and
smelly rooms.
Must have been
last renovated in
the 70's.             1
My bf and I stayed
one night and
wish we would of
stayed more
nights I have
never slept so well
and felt more
refreshed, my bf
enjoyed it as well.   5
This wasn't a bad
stay but unless
you are stuck
walking to
someplace
nearby, you can
find better places
for the money.
The room was
clean and crisp.
The USB at the
desk wouldn't
charge and there
wasn't an outlet
close to the bed.
The security gate
exit is stuck open.
Not many food
options nearby
and the staff had
no
recommendations.
No breakfast. The
broken down van
in the front
parking lot did not
snatch me. I
thought the
gardens were real
pretty when
booking but I don't
think any rooms
with that view
were available as
it seemed
everyone was in
the rooms that
were motel style
with the parking
lot.                  3
Bed sheets seem
like they weren't
changed, it has
that icky feeling
and smells like
lots of chemicals
spray. Woke up to
bug bites on the
lower legs. It's a
nightmare.
                      1
Room is okay and
kinda fine. Has a
fridge and
microwave.
Bathroom looks
like it’s from the
70’s or 80’s hella
old and dookie.        3
We did not end up
staying here.
Super sketchy
people hanging
around outside.
There were
domestics going
on and a window
was shattered
across the
courtyard. Did not
feel safe here at
all. We checked in
and out in less
than 10 minutes        1
I stayed at this
hotel for a night
and I will NEVER
be back! I was
treated poorly at
this place and
highly feel that I
was discriminated
against.               1
Was a nice stay.
Room was on the
first floor which
was nice and
accessible. Was
there for a week
and had no
problems other
than a broken ice
machine on the
first floor. My only
complaint is that
amenities were
rather expensive.
Even a bottled
water at the
vending machine
cost $2.50.
Obviously a hotel
is going to have
WiFi was really
good, even the
non-paid was fast
enough for me to
stream. The TV in
the room was nice
as it could play
YouTube videos.
Only complaint is
that it didn't save
sign ins between
days like it said it
would and that the
smart TV internet
sometimes
seemed worse
than the wifi.
inflated prices for
amenities but this
was kind of
ridiculous.
                       5
Age shows.
Guess this place
was built long time
ago as the
standard rooms
are really tiny.
Hard to set a
suitcase in the
room and move
around. Also feels
very cold and
metallic ...reminds
me of a Motel 6
.... did not try any
food there             2
Sketchy area,
booked because
low rates, but still
not worth it,
homeless across
in park area, loud
music inside own
parking lot,
homeless n
transients on local
streets, room
smell, need major
remodel n update       1
