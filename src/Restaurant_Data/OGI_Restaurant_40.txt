What has
happened to
Olive
Garden!!!! I
don’t know if is
because the
management or
what it’s the
deal. I don’t
know what’s
their problem
with the salad
that they are
super stingy.
This is my
second time
having the
same
experience. (
but the first
time the
waitress was
the best make
sure of taking
care of me) so
because of
waitress I let it
go.
I went by
myself and
waitress served
me salad for
one, then I
asked if I could
have more
salad and she
said, but your
food it’s about
to come out, I
said I want
some salad
anyway. It has
not pass 10
minutes after
she brought my
food and my
plate it’s full still
and she asked,
do you want a
box? I said no
thank you.
Then later the
manager came
to asked if
everything was
ok? I wave my
hand back
saying xoxo.
He said how
we can make it
right? I said I
talk to you
later. I didn’t
wanted to put
him in blast in
front of
customers.
Then the
manager
leaving and
waitress came
again do you
want a box?
Man! People
give some
training to your
workers! You
can’t make the
customer feel
that they need
to leave!!! Stop
being stingy
with the salad!
How much
lettuce can cost
man!! Be the
Olive Garden
we used to
remember. I left
lasagna on
plate, super
bad. Stepped it
for costumers
man! Where
America it’s
going? Just
taking your
money and
give you
garbage! Oh
well
disappointed.       1
I am very
disappointed to
have to leave
this review. My
daughter and I
love to go to
Olive Garden
and most of the
time we have a
nice
experience. I
am pretty sure
we were pre
judged when
we arrived as
being a couple
of "Karens", but
we never had
the chance to
prove
otherwise,
even when we
tried to engage
our server the
few times we
saw him. We
were seated at
the smallest
table in the
place, which
would have
been fine if the
rest of the visit
had been good.
A table of 5
was seated
right next to us
after we had
been there for
about 10 mins.
That table had
beverages
before we were
ever greeted.
My daughter
ordered a
drink, which
wasn't full, and
was very weak.
The entrée was
served after
just a couple of
sips of soup. I
had ordered
the soup, salad
and bread
sticks, but
wasn't able to
eat the salad
due to some
dental work.
The server said
he would box it
up for me to
take home. We
also ordered a
pint of soup to
go. At the end
of the meal, we
waited for quite
a while for the
to go order.
When it finally
came, there
was no salad,
and no little
bag for the
remaining
bread sticks.
We tried to pay
the check with
the ziosk at the
table, but it
didn't work. So
we tried to call
the server, but
no one came.
We took the
check to the
front counter
but couldn't pay
there. They
called a server
that they
thought was
ours, but he
came up, said
"that's not my
table" and
walked away.
Another server
came over, and
asked to look
at the check.
He saw who
the correct
server was and
called him over.
We were finally
able to pay the
check and
leave. There
were other
issues, but the
review is
getting too
long.
                   1
We went for my
birthday
yesterday. We
were told 25
min wait. No
problem.
Checked in, left
for 15 min.
Came back
and were
seated
immediately.
We ordered
drinks and
appetizers from
the kiosk.
That's all you
can order from
the kiosk. 1
appetizer was
brought
dropped and
the waiter ran
off so fast we
couldn't talk to
him. Then we
were forgotten.
No drinks were
served. No
water was
brought. No
order was
taken. For an
hour. Trying to
pay at the kiosk
was impossible
due to the
order only
being half filled.
So more
waiting, Trying
to find
someone who
would stop and
help us pay
and leave.
                     1
2 hour long
wait to be
seated and 30
minutes later
table next us
was seated
and received
drinks,
appetizers, and
salad. No one
even came up
to our table to
even ask us for
drinks or
appetizers.          1
This was the
worst
experience
we've ever had
at Olive Garden
here and it's
been a couple
of years since
we've dined
here. First of
all, they didn't
start by asking
if we'd like to
taste the wine
of the evening.
Then our
entree came
before our
appetizers.
Also, we
ordered
unlimited soup
AND salad and
they didn't bring
out the salad
until we asked
a completely
different server.
Didn't ask us if
we wanted
cheese on
anything. There
was absolutely
no seasoning
on practically
anything and
overcooked.
Soups were
watery and no
gnocchi in the
Gnocchi! No
refills on the
salad and we
had to ask for
refills on the
soups and
drinks. Server
barely came to
check on us.
Oh, this is little
but didn't even
give us Andes
chocolates
when we paid!!!
And had the
nerve to circle
the tip chart on
the receipt
when giving us
the check.
Wow. We used
to really like
Olive Garden.
But if this is the
type of service
now, this is a
serious
downgrade.
                     1
Service was
poor.
Everybody at
the table got
their drinks
except for my
wife. Her
dinner order
was messed
up, twice. She
asked for her
steak medium
well and both
times it was
well done (the
second time it
was over
seasoned as
well). We had
three servers
that night, of
the three only
one was polite.
Manager came
to the table to
apologize and
offered to take
her order off
our bill and a
free dessert.
Will not be
returning here.     1
Manger was
rude. I
complained
about
asparagus
being too hard
to eat. He just
stood over our
food and said.
So what do you
want me to do?
Smart like. I
said I know I
don't want you
to stand here
and act like it's
okay. I'd like to
finish the rest
of my food.

My experience
at this
restaurant on
March lane
Stkn was the
worst. I went to
celebrate my
51st birthday
with family, I
couldn't order a
glass of wine
because ID
expired 1 day
ago the
bartender said
if I had proof
that renewal of
License receipt
I could order a
drink. which I
did and the
manager still
didn't let me
buy anything. I
saw family
member there
that is barely
22 yrs old and
her friend.
They had
drinks and
weren't ID????
The food was
bland, lasagna
not good.I
Wasted
$300.00 at this
restaurant for
family
celebration that
was the worst..
don't
recommend
going here.
Also feel like if
ID is the most
important they
should make
sure they do to
all guest
ordering
alcohol. Not
just pick and
choosing who
to discriminate
against.            1
They have an
online check-in
but when you
arrive your wait
time starts over
from the time
you get to the
restaurant.
Their response:
oh it just helps
us prepare for
the incoming
customers.
That doesn't
help me
prepare my
time when I
have other
things to do
and I'm
thinking I
checked in
already. If I
would've
known I would
have came in
the restaurant.
                   1
I worked there
as well as a
customer, the
place was dirty
in the back and
the food not
fresh, it's not
even authentic
italian. The
management
doesn't care
either.            1
Super
expensive
SLOW
service...food
was great but
the reason why
I have only 1
star it's
because my
waiter was
super slow, and
he charged me
for 2 additional
drinks
(margaritas)
that I never
have! I called
the next day
and spoke to
the MOD and
he kindly
refunded my
money. This
message is
also in
response to the
owner. I don't
want to email
your manager
since your
manager was
able to take
care of the
issue, and yes
food is good
but prices went
up drastically
☹ Thanks           1
The food was
very dry,
disappointing
for the price.
Took a bit
longer than it
should have to
get your drink
even though it
wasn't a busy
time. Not sure if
its just the
Stockton one or
if all olive
garden food is
dry but I
definitely will
cross this place
off my list of
"good food,
service, and
environment"
                    1
So I have gone
there twice
figured,
hey just
because the
first time didn’t
work out the
second time
might’ve been
better.
WOW was I
wrong my
noodles came
out under
cooked and
overcooked I
ordered I
ordered
fettuccine
Alfredo with
shrimp and
chicken and
the shrimp and
the chicken
were not in the
freaking
fettuccine.
My waitress
that I had
totally sucked if
it seem like she
had never been
a waiter before.
Needless to
say I will not be
going back          1
We went for a
late lunch me
and my family
we did not
have great
service we
waited over 3
hours to eat we
didn't get our
drinks until
about the first
hour and a half
then the lady
that was our
host lost our
order then said
they would
replace the
order make the
order took
another
another hour
we were seeing
people coming
and going at
this point we
wanted to
leave we tried
to give them
the benefit of
the doubt I will
never eat here
again.              1
My husband
and I have
been going to
the olive
garden for
years it's
always been
good food. So
we got togo
orders, with
dinners,
appetizers, and
2 Desserts, the
works. When
we got home,
$80.some
dollars later, it
was Burnt on
the bottom of
both chicken
fried steaks,
they were so
dry the
breading
separated from
the meat. and
Wrong dessert.
80$ in the
trash. Won't
ever
do it again.        1
Went in and to
my surprised
was seated
very quickly for
a Saturday
night, the place
wasn't busy
either.
However we
NEVER got a
waiter to come
to our table I
noticed the
people behind
me that were
being seated
were already
eating their
soups. I seen
three
waitresses
talking and
tried to signal
one of them
over and they
quickly looked
away. Finally a
waiter walked
by our table
only to be
walking passed
us, that's when
I flagged him
down and
asked if we
would be given
a waiter? He
walked to the
front and
NEVER came
back! We
waited 35 min
and walked
out. VERY
disappointed in
Olive Garden I
absolutely love
this place and
always receive
the best
waiters
however, this
time was the
worst
considering it
was our
anniversary.       1
This place
doesn't
deserve a star,
but to post
something you
have to. We
took our
granddaughter
to Lunch/
dinner there,
and the waiter
was slow. 2
tables that
came after us
had thier Soup/
Salad and thier
order came out
when we got
our
Soup/Salad.
Our food was
disgusting and
when we asked
for bread when
we got our
meal, she
forgot it. She
came with the
bread when we
were done and
said she was
sorry. I couldn't
get a refill on
our drinks until
after she
brought the
bread. First
time there and
we'll Never go
back. $60.00
was not worth
what we got.        1
Food was great
I recommend
.Greeters not
so nice they
rolled their
eyes at us for
asking a
question. They
sat a bunch of
people before
us.Even though
we were there
before them.
Our waitress
was amazing
greeters not so
much. Besides
that food was
great.              1
Last week I
went to olive
garden food
was so great,
we decided to
go tonite. Sadly
our meat tasted
sour.. so
disappointed
…                   1
Seated in bar
with dried food
chunks on my
utensils, 3 ice
cubes in my
ICED tea,
waiter never
asked about
meal or refills
but had time to
bs with
bartender and
staff. Did not
eat my food,
but hey, my
wife loves the
place. She'll be
going with kids
and grandkids
from now on.        1
I placed an
order through
their website
and arrived on
time it said it
would be ready
to be picked
up. I checked
in and the
young guy at
the front said
he was
checking in on
my order,
twenty minutes
later past the
pick up time
and I saw he
was clocking
out and didn't
even bother to
check in on us
or say anything
about our order
anymore. I had
to ask
someone else
about it and
they said that
he never even
asked for my
food to be
brought to the
front. Got home
and the food
was cold and
lacked in flavor,
didn't even get
to enjoy it since
it was already
cold.               1
Worst dinner
experience
ever! Fried
seafood should
be crispy and
not like it come
from another
person's plate.
Food was
bland and cool.     1
The guy that
served us
(Gabino C.)
was somewhat
out of it and
rude. I would
ask for refills
and stuff but
before I could
finish talking he
was walking
away. And we
also had
ordered a
pitcher that
served 4ppl
(only for two in
our case) and it
only served our
TWO glasses
they were
saying that its
all about
"perseption"
like you're
literally false
advertising a
big pitcher for
this little thing.
They said the
ice was
supposed to
make the glass
look Fuller. We
have sensitive
teeth so we
said light ice.
And we would
ask him for
bread sticks
and he would
bring only three
and plus it was
my cousins
birthday... I
wouldn't want
him to serve us
again. Heck we
might not go
there again
✌️                   1
Food was not
bad other than
the salad being
warm, the
worst part were
the babies
screaming! I
guess it's a
family place
which is
understandable
but definitely
won't go back if
you can't eat in
peace!               1
Bad service.
Had us waiting
15 mins before
taking our
order while
some server
was busy
taking care of
his relatives.       1
Worst service
by far in the
world! Wish I
could rate
lower. The sad
part is they
weren't even
busy. On top of
that what
restaurant
charges for
water?              1
We had the all-
you-can-eat
stuffed pasta,
the first serving
what's cold and
the second
serving came
out with the
pasta way
smaller than
the first one
and it was cold
and dry and the
fat white lady
hostess was
rude and had a
horrible attitude
towards me.         1
Bad I'm sorry
but they need
to figure
something out
screaming
DOOR is
triggering trying
to enjoy a nice
dinner with the
wife and all you
hear is DOOR
every three
seconds.
Figure
something out
that is
Ridiculous          1
Waited over 2
and 1/2 hrs to
be seated and
then the food
wasn't that
good                1
Bathroom was
a disaster!
Wonder what
the kitchen
looks like. I
wasn't willing to
take my
chances! Left
before we were
even sat!           1
Last night I
called in my
order 1/2 gal.
Of soup and
bread sticks . I
waited 35 min.
Worst
customer
service.            1
Left me not
wanting to
come back.
Maybe it was
the dish,
maybe the
entire
experience.
Either way, I'm
not coming
back here any
time soon.         1
They were too
busy to assist
us. We walked
out of our
table. Not a
good
experience this
time.              1
Gave my entire
family food
poisoning. Will
never be eating
here again.        1
Food was cold
service not very
good drinks
were awful,
won't go back
to Stockton one    1
Given several
chances.
Scimpy on
alfredo sauce.
Only two olives
in the whole
salad. It is the
Olive
Garden....right?
Bread was
hard.              1
Not happy with
veggie
noodles. Not
the best plate
on the menu.
But other food
was good.          1
Not a good
night..waited
over 45
mins..super
cold and the
steak was
terrible like
leather and
tasted like
liver..very
unsatisfied...     1
Service was
horrible and
food took
forever. Worst
experience I
have had at
Olive Garden.      1
Extremely long
wait, food is
soso. Out of
items on the
menu.              1
