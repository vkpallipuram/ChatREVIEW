                  I just wish the

                 effective as the
                 lectures
                 because I
                 simply learn
                 more efficiently
                 on my own. I

It's
discouraging to
attend office
hours and ask
questions and
receive subtle
shaming for not
understanding
much in
response.
It's a difficult
subject to teach
because
different
students have
wildly different
aptitudes
towards this
kind of thinking.
I'm not sure
what the
solution to that
is                 perhaps
more time on
low-level C? It but at the
might also feel same time that

More lecture
would be nice
rather than in

time. I find that
the in class
work time is not
always
effective.
It would have
been good if we
did labs in
groups or
partners so
there is some
sort of
colloboration.

Class expects
you to learn
quick and
usually use the
basic
knowledge they
give to do more
advanced stuff.
I didn't like
during the        or the labs
pandemic         were too long
which was        to complete
doing a quiz on due to the lack
every lecture of guidance

having it be     recommend
due on the       more in class

instead of       devoted to
having it be     reviewing old

being able to applying
practice a       concepts that
concept. I felt we just learned
we were not      in class in a
given enough form closer to

A common
thing with this
teacher is that
he doesn't do a
good job
explaining
specifics that
would have
been very
relevant to
know before a
test or lab is
completed
(some
requirements
were not
specified
directly). There
also needs to
be some class
time devoted to
explaining the
lab. This would
be nice for                      he has an
